            For the last 8 years Ive spent my life on every valentines saying me and who
            <br>
            For the last 3 years I always thought I could never be loved, I thought no one would ever see me in that light
            <br>
            But ever since i met u on 17th of june 2023 my life changed it went upside down round and round
            <br>
            The day I asked you out was the day where taher was so confident about himself to have a girl like <span style="color:hotpink">YOU</span> with him
            <br>
            someone so beautiful hot and sexy 
            <br> 
            <span style="color:hotpink"><b> My Heart sank that day, My Eyes felt joy, My will to work hard got more, and My brain felt peace</b></span>
            <p>
                Since then my life has been a rollercoaster ride for me
                <br>
                And Iam glad you were the one sitting besides me
                <br>
                To date you till I marry will be the wisest decision Ill ever make and on that thought I would like to ask you that....
                <br>
